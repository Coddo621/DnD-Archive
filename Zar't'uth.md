A small but notable trading island of the coast of the Orcish nation of Dridzord. Since its mainly a trading society the number of permanent inhabitants is a little over 5000. The primary inhabitants are orcs, but that doesn't matter since the island is guild-controlled. Some of the guilds that hold the most control on the island are as follows: The Silent Enclave, a large thieve faction comprised of mostly human rouges; The Emerald Brigade, an elven trading faction known for breaking the one rule of elves "Never trade with outsiders"; The Broken Brawn, comprised of multiple races, a faction that sanctions individuals who've been wronged by their country as military veterans. 
Since the island is mainly a trading colony, not many laws are in place, except for the obvious ones that prohibit harm and murder, besides that there's only one custom that everyone take seriously, scamming is prohibited, sort of an "Honor among thieves". The climate is tundra-like with the weather progressively getting worse and colder the closer you are to the center. The terrain is mostly comprised of mountains in which settlements have been carved into, the outskirts of the island however, is surprisingly flat and beach-like, the reason why it's such an accessible trading spot. No notable natural landmarks have been spotted on the island, however there are rumors of a oceanic cave somewhere along the coastline, no one has yet to confirm this rumor though. The structures are made in a brutalist style with a focus on function over style. This makes it easier to utilize defenses as the defenses consist of several watchtowers placed around the outskirts of the island, the people patrolling these watchtowers are several gunned patrol officers.
The islands structure is quite diverse.  It's build in a way that allows an overhead metro system to function flawlessly, made to favor the unruly terrain.
